typical very basic instance:
ABABABAB 
4 bytes - class index
{
for each property: 
4 bytes property index
4 bytes type index
4 bytes value
}

00 00 00 00 is bool (1 byte)
01 00 00 00 maybe its an Int8
02 00 00 00 is int			<- pretty sure thats singed int
03 00 00 00 is uint			<- cant confirm 8 bytes long for that i suspect uint32
05 00 00 00 is single float (4 bytes)
06 00 00 00 is double float (8bytes)
07 00 00 00 is string with a 4 bytes STRG table reference
08 00 00 00 is WideString, 4 bytes uint describe the length, which has to be read encoded UTF-16 (Unicode)

09 00 00 00 BB BB BB BB is a object reference, following 4 bytes are the instance id classId is next 4 bytes
09 00 00 00 AA AA AA AA are TRANS table references 4 bytes uint as index following

0B 00 00 00 is 12 byte vector: 4byte x, 4byte y, 4byte z (single float all)
0C 00 00 00 is a 16 bytes Color A R G B
0D 00 00 00 is Color 4 bytes A R G B one byte each

11 00 00 00 is an array, following 4 bytes are the length of the array (offset E095 for a good example (string list) 
12 00 00 00 seems to be a map list first 4bytes arraySize; element: 8byte string type/value; usual object reference 16 byte

14 00 00 00 is a data blobb

18 00 00 00 (seems to be 2 bytes) {TLoadableQuadTextureAnimatedBlade} : {AlignementY} (signed short?)

19 00 00 00 2 bytes 88 / 550 "InitStage" might ne short int (int16) probably unsigned

1A 00 00 00 is a GUID for descriptors

1c 00 00 00 is string for filenames 4 bytes STRG table reference

1D 00 00 00 is 8 byte, its a localisation hash -> points to an entry of the *.dic (TRAD) files

1E 00 00 00 seems to be a ZIP block / content block

1F 00 00 00 It might be a int32 pair
{TEugBMutableInt2}: Value  
{TConstantInt2}: Value  
{TInt2OptionFlashDescriptor}: {DegradationMapping}

21 00 00 00 is 8 byte, look like some kind of double float too me but we alreay have that.

22 00 00 00 Marks an entry of a list as "map" entry: string-value pair

25 00 00 00 is 16 bytes {APrioriHashToSusbtitutedSourceHash} i suspect md5 hash here.


14 00 00 00 is a data blobb:
struct blobHead {
	DWORD blobMagic; // 14 00 00 00 
	DWORD sumLength;

//blob block[sumLength];

}

struct subBlock {
	DWORD subLengthCompressed
	DWORD subLengthUncompressed
	blob subBlock[subLengthCompressed];
}



11 00 00 00
DWORD length
object list {

09 00 00 00 BB BB BB BB marks an entry
DWORD object index
DWORD classid

}
